"""Hot-serve for ``gateway.multiplex_profiles``: keep the served-profile set in step with ``profiles/``
while the multiplexer runs, instead of snapshotting it once at boot.

Three things were start-time snapshots: the secondary adapter set (``_start_secondary_profile_adapters``),
the ``served_profiles`` record in ``gateway_state.json`` (``_record_served_profiles``) and the cron
ticker's ``profile_homes`` list. Everything else (``/p/<profile>/`` prefixes, profile-route eligibility,
handoff/kanban watchers, shared ingress) already reads ``profiles_to_serve()`` / ``_profile_adapters``
live, so reconciling those three is enough for a profile created after boot to be served.

``reconcile_served_profiles`` runs on the loop under one lock, triggered by the ``rescan-profiles`` control
verb (``hermes_cli/profiles.py`` create/delete fire it through the control socket) and by the supervised
``_profile_reconcile_watcher`` every ``_PROFILE_RESCAN_INTERVAL_SECS`` as the safety net. A served profile whose ``config.yaml``/``.env``
changed since its adapters were last built is re-scanned too: creators make the profile first and add the
bot token afterwards, and without this an adapter-less profile would stay adapter-less forever.
